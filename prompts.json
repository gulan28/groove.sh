    "lofi": [
        "Generate a space-themed lo-fi beat that combines ambient cosmic sounds with downtempo rhythms. Incorporate ethereal synth textures, gentle piano melodies, and occasional subtle 'space transmission' effects to evoke the feeling of floating through a starlit void. Ensure the track has a continuous, weightless quality that induces relaxation and wonder.",
        "Create a retro-futuristic lo-fi composition inspired by 80s sci-fi soundtracks. Blend warm analog synth tones with modern lo-fi percussion, adding occasional vaporwave-style effects. The track should evoke nostalgia while maintaining a futuristic edge, with a steady, calming rhythm that's perfect for focused work or relaxation.",
        "Produce a bio-mechanical lo-fi beat that fuses organic sounds with synthetic elements. Incorporate gentle nature recordings (like rainforest ambience or ocean waves) seamlessly with soft electronic pulses and mellow synth melodies. The track should evoke a sense of harmony between technology and nature, maintaining a soothing and continuous flow.",
        "Compose a time-travel themed lo-fi track that blends elements from different eras. Mix vinyl crackles and vintage instrument samples with futuristic synth arpeggios and subtle glitch effects. The beat should have a dreamlike quality, as if drifting through time, while maintaining a consistent, relaxing rhythm suitable for background listening or meditation.",
        "Generate an AI-inspired lo-fi composition that explores the concept of artificial consciousness. Use soft, evolving synthesizer pads, gentle digital blips, and a steady, muffled beat to create a contemplative atmosphere. The track should feel both introspective and expansive, with subtle algorithmic elements that add a sense of emerging intelligence within a calming lo-fi framework.",
        "Create a solarpunk lo-fi track that embodies an optimistic vision of a sustainable future. Blend soft acoustic elements (like wooden percussion or wind chimes) with clean, futuristic synth tones. Incorporate subtle sounds of renewable energy (like gentle wind turbines or soft solar panel hums) into the rhythm. The overall feel should be bright, hopeful, and rejuvenating while maintaining the relaxed lo-fi aesthetic.",
        "Generate a neo-Tokyo lo-fi beat that captures the essence of a futuristic Japanese metropolis at night. Blend traditional Japanese instrument samples (like soft shamisen or koto) with cyberpunk-inspired synth arpeggios and a gentle urban soundscape (distant traffic, neon buzz). The track should evoke images of high-tech skyscrapers and peaceful hidden gardens, maintaining a serene yet futuristic lo-fi vibe throughout."
